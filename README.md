# Simon-Game
In this project I used Jquery to develop a game called "Simon" an interactive game focuses on memorization skill


The game basically randomly picks colors and their order as pattern. User has to follow this pattern in every level, one mistake in clicking the colors results in failed state which leads the game into restart phase.
